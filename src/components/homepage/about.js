                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Katya a.k.a. Carry Key.<br/>Welcome to my site!</p>
                <p>Iâ€™ve been working as a photographer, photo editor and graphic designer until I decided to pursue my passion full-time and become a professional cosplay model. And here I am - crafting, painting, wigmaking, sometimes sewing, still photo editing, staying in shape and polishing my acting skills - who said it would be easy? ðŸ˜„</p>
                {/* <p className="socialMedia mobile"><Link to={'/contact'}>Social media</Link></p> */}
                <p>Iâ€™m happy to share my passion with you and make characters come alive with a touch of my personal creative vision. Please enjoy my work and contact me anytime if you have any questions!</p>
                {/* <p className="socialMedia tablet"><Link to={'/contact'}>Social media</Link></p> */}
